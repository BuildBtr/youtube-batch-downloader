Excellent work! 
This script has been officially approved and is almost ready to be uploaded to the repository. We only need official documentation for developers and possibly a "requirements.txt" file for dependencies. 

# Please help me finish this process by following these steps:
Step 1: Determine if a "requirements.txt" file is needed. If so, please generate it!

Step 2: Carefully determine what info is needed to make a detailed and comprehensive official documentation geared towards developers that will use this script in the future. Please generate a "README.md: after finishing reasoning.
